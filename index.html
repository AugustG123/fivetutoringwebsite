<p class='content'>We are 5 juniors currently enrolled in the Math, Science ,and Technology Center at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. We each take academics seriously and consequently have notable
     accolades and accomplishments, such as 36 ACT, 4.0 GPA with mostly Advanced and AP classes, and multiple 5s on AP Exams. You can find out more about us on our About Us page. 
     We also have a combined 1000+ hours of tutoring experience. Because we believe that every child deserves the opportunity to receive high-quality co-curricular education,
      we offer our personalized tutoring service at the price of $13 per hour. All of the funds we collect are used to maintain and improve our business, and any excess 
      funds will be returned to the community by means of donations to Dance Blue. You can sign up for tutoring on our Sign Up page.
